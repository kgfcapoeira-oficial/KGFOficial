# Filhos do Fogo - Capoeira Management App

## Overview

Filhos do Fogo is a community management and educational platform for a Capoeira martial arts group. The application provides role-based dashboards for students (alunos), professors, and administrators to manage classes, events, payments, assignments, uniforms, music, and student progress tracking.

The app is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities, allowing members to access key features on mobile devices. It integrates with Supabase for authentication, database storage, and file uploads.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with a custom dark theme (stone/orange color palette)

### Routing Strategy
- Custom state-based routing managed in `App.tsx` using `currentView` state
- No React Router - navigation handled through `onNavigate` callbacks passed to components
- Views organized in `/views` directory, pages in `/src/pages` directory

### Component Architecture
- Custom components in `/components` directory styled with Tailwind
- AI_RULES.md specifies preference for shadcn/ui components for new UI elements
- Lucide React for all iconography
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

### State Management
- React's built-in `useState` and `useCallback` hooks for component state
- `SessionContextProvider` wraps the app for authentication state management
- Data states (events, payments, assignments, etc.) managed at App.tsx level and passed down as props

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase Auth for user authentication (email/password)
- Role-based access control with three roles: `admin`, `professor`, `aluno`
- Profile setup flow for new users via `ProfileSetup` component
- Session management through `useSession` hook

### Data Models
- TypeScript interfaces defined in `types.ts` at root level
- Key entities: User, ClassSession, GroupEvent, Assignment, PaymentRecord, UniformOrder, StudentGrade, MusicItem, HomeTraining, SchoolReport, EventRegistration
- FFPoints system: FFTask, FFTaskCompletion, FFReward, FFRedemption

### FFPoints Rewards System
- Points currency called "FFPoints" earned by completing admin-created tasks
- Points redeemed for rewards (uniforms, instruments, accessories, etc.)
- All users (alunos, professors, admins) can earn and redeem points
- Admin creates/manages tasks and rewards; approves/rejects completion and redemption requests
- View: `views/FFPoints.tsx` — self-contained component with its own Supabase queries
- Database tables: `ff_tasks`, `ff_task_completions`, `ff_rewards`, `ff_redemptions`
- SQL migration: `supabase_ffpoints_migration.sql` — must be run in Supabase SQL Editor
- Integrated as a tab in all three dashboards (Admin: ⭐ FFPoints tab; Professor: button in action grid; Aluno: ⭐ FFPoints tab)

### PWA Configuration
- Vite PWA plugin configured in `vite.config.ts`
- Service worker for offline caching
- Custom manifest with Capoeira branding
